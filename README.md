# Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts student academic performance based on study hours
and attendance using Machine Learning techniques.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To predict student marks using historical academic data and identify
patterns that affect performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection (study hours, attendance)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error

## 📊 Sample Prediction
Input:
- Study Hours: 6
- Attendance: 80%

Output:
- Predicted Marks: ~64

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of supervised learning
- Hands-on experience with regression models
- Model evaluation techniques
